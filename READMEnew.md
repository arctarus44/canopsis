## What is Canopsis ? 

[Canopsis](http://canopsis.org) is an open-source [hypervisor](http://www.capensis.fr/solutions/hypervision/) whose goal is to aggregate/consolidate information and events metrics of different types such as performance, availability, etc.) coming from multiple sources to create a global solution for monitoring and administrating resources.

Built to last on top of [proven Open Source technologies by and for all IT professionals](http://www.capensis.fr/solutions/supervision/). It is an event based architecture and it is modular by design. Plug your infrastructure tools like `Syslog`, [`Nagios`](https://git.canopsis.net/canopsis-connectors/connector-neb2canopsis), [`Shinken`](https://git.canopsis.net/canopsis-connectors/connector-shinken2canopsis), [`...`](https://git.canopsis.net/canopsis-connectors) to [Canopsis](http://canopsis.org) and you're ready to go.
