Description
===========

A graph is inherited from the mathematical structure of hypergraphs with some technical features such as information on edges.

Three type of elements describe a graph, the :ref:`vertices <FR__Graph__vertice>`,
the :ref:`edges <FR__Graph__edge>`, and the :ref:`graphs <FR__Graph__graph>`.

.. _FR__Graph__vertice:

Vertice
-------

A vertice is an element which can embed an information.

It contains:

- unique id.
- several type names in order to ease classification of vertices.

Its lifecycle is independent from graphs, therefore, one vertice can be used by several graphs, but it does not directly graphs which use it.

.. _FR__Graph__edge:

Edge
----

An edge inherits from vertice and links source vertice(s) with target vertice(s).

An edge contains the boolean property ``oriented`` which permits to distinguish or not target from sources.

.. _FR__Graph__graph:

Graph
-----

A graph is a vertice used such as a set of vertices.
