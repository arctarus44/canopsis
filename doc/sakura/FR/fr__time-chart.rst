.. _FR__Title__Desc:

Description
-----------

This widget fetch data (metrics, events log, pbehaviors) from the backend depending on it's configuration. This allows metric display over time that comes with many features and options described below.


Features
--------

Simple chart from series or metrics
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The timechart widget have to show in the configuration form the possibility to select data source ``from canopsis series or directly from canopsis perfdata``. This two way of selecting metric data have make the widget display a chart in an unified way. This means that series and perfdata manage the same kind of data and then have to be ``managed the same way``.

Human readables values
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

All Data measurement that can be displayed into the widget have to be optionnaly human readable. This means that numeric values have to be transformed to display the user values that are more understandable. This way, and for instance, a 1 Gigabyte value that is fetched from backend with values like ``1 000 000 000`` have to be shown like ``1Gu`` where u is the metric unit. This is done on the chart everywhere it appears (axes, tooltip, legend) with u the appropriate unit.

Timewindow
<<<<<<<<<<

The user configuring a timechart widget have to be able to choose a timewindow within data are fetched. This timewindow will tell the widget to fetch data ``between a target time : (to) and (to - timewindow)``.

Zoom
<<<<

Zoom feature enable the widget to be clickable (drag and drop) in order to ``display a subset period of the widget configured timewindow``. When the action of zoom is triggered, the widget will focus the main chart display on the date interval ``from start date to stop date`` defined by the interactive ``information gathered on drag and drop user action``. This feature is available by default.

History view
<<<<<<<<<<<<

History view is an ``embeded chart at the bottom of the main chart`` displaying the same metric information configured by series and perfdata in the widget configuration but with a timewindow that does not vary when the main chart is zoomed. The history timewindow is the same as the general configuration one. This feature is optional depending on widget configuration available.

Show events log
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The chart have to be able to show event log data within the start and stop date of the chart configuration. The events log information comes with the ``custom filter`` system that will allow the user to generate custom filters for ``specific event log selection``. Events log once fetched will be displayed on the chart and their ``information have to be reachable`` and can be templated with handlebars.

Stacked charts
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The chart series can be in stacked display mode. This mode will put the metrics on the chart the one upon the other additionnaly in order to display a ``cummulative chart``.

Multiple axes X-Y
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Allow display data series within different axes. This feature ``allows to compare many data series``. The widget configuration will have an editor that enable series to axes mapping.


Customizable labels
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

On the tooltip, in the legend and on axes, metric information labled have to be editable. This is done thanks to an ``handlebars template`` that will describe how to compute labels from the metric informations. metric labels are by computed by default with the metric name.


Display downtime
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Downtime periods are displayed as ``coloured background intervals`` on the chart. Downtime periods are fetched from api and then displayed on the chart and the history chart.


Tooltip et shared tooltip
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

It is possible to display tooltip for each point on the chart that will display the ``value on a popover`` element on the chart. The shared version will show all metrics data that exists at the same X axis point.


Threshold
<<<<<<<<<

Defining a threshold value will display on the chart a line in the ``Y axis``. This helps to get better understanding of metric values over time. Thresholds can be ``minor, major critical``.

Timewindow offset
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Tells the widget to move the ``to`` value of the data period selection of the offset value in the past. This leads to a time shift.

Baseline
<<<<<<<<

Enable display time series of the ``same metric with it's past data on the same chart``. By setting a timewindow in the widget, the user defines a period. He can for this feature also define an occurence number that will tell how many times a new series from selected metric information will be fetched in the past for the timewindow period.


Display mode
<<<<<<<<<<<<

The chart series can be displayed with one of the following type: ``line, area or bar``. Value is general and can be specialized by serie.


Dot representation
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

It is possible to choose the ``shape of data points`` (dot, circle, square, triangle) on the chart by ``selecting a shape and a size`` for each serie.


Display associated pbehaviors
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Pbehavior information can be ``fetched by the widget`` and be displayed on the chart depending on their period. These pbehavior information are fetched ``depending on the metric selection`` when activated.


Trend lines
<<<<<<<<<<<

It is possible to select a ``forcast duration`` until when the ``trend of a serie is computed``. This option have to be ``available for baselines too``.
