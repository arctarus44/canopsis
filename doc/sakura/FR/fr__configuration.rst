Description
===========

A configurable is the base class for all python classes in Canopsis.

It is linked to at least one configuration resource, such as file or data base document.

All resources are transformed in a unified configuration language;

.. _FR__Configurable__configuration:

Configuration
=============

The configuration uses a unified langage which is agnostic from configuration resources, and several configuration resources in order to allow configuration overriding.

.. _FR__Configurable__Configuration__Overriding:

Configuration overriding/inheritance
------------------------------------

According to class inheritance, a Configurable can use self configuration resources, and ones defined at a base class level. In such way, the final configuration is based from base class configuration, and it is possible to apply a fined grained configuration with a specific Configuration instance.

.. _FR__Configurable__Configuration__Language:

Configuration Language
----------------------

The configuration langage is composed of three concepts:

- **Configuration**: set of categories by name.
- **Category**: set of parameters by name, and is identified by a name.
- **Parameter**: identified by a name. It uses also a default value and uses a parser in order to get a value from a serialized string value.

.. _FR__Configurable__Registry:

Configurable Registry
=====================

A configurable registry is a configurable which is composed of configurables.

.. _FR__Configurable__Driver:

Driver
======

A configuration driver permits to access to a configurable configuration, whatever the nature of the existing configuration resource.

Example of drivers are:

- FileDriver : dedicated to condfiguration files.
- DBDriver : dedicated to configuration database.
